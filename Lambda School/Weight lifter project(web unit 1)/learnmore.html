        <h1>Major Health and Fitness Benefits of Lifting Weights</h1> 
        <div class ="para">
        <h2>1. You'll Torch More Body Fat</h2>

        <h4><p> Lifting weights can increase your lean body mass, which increases the number of overall
         calories you burn during the day," says Jacque Crockford, CSCS and spokesperson for the American 
         Council on Exercise. Burning extra calories post-workout plus building muscle? 
         That's the surefire way to get the body you want.</p></h4>
		
		
		
         <h2>2. And You'll Especially Lose Belly Fat</h2>


         <h4><p>While it is true that you can't spot reduce—your body is born with pre-conceived places
         it wants to store fat<br>a University of Alabama study found that the women who lifted weights lost 
         more intra-abdominal fat (deep belly fat) than those who just did cardio. <br>This not only helps
         you lose weight and build a more toned body, but it also lessens your risk of diabetes, 
         metabolic syndrome, and some cancers.</p></h4>

         <h2>3.  Your Muscles Will Look More Defined</h2>
		
		
        <h4><p>Love the lean, defined muscles on super-fit ladies? "If women
        want more defination, they should lift heavier since they cannot get
        ger muscles because of low testosterone levels," says Jason Karp,
        an exercise physiologist and author."so, lifting heavier has the 
        potential to make women more defined."</p></h4>


        <h2>4.  Burn More Calories Than Cardio</h2>

        <h4><p>Why? Your muscle mass largely determines your resting metabolic 
        rate—how many calories you burn by just living and breathing. "The more 
        muscle you have, the more energy your body expends," says Perkins.
       "Everything you do, from brushing your teeth, to sleeping, to checking 
        Instagram, you'll be burning more calories," Perkins says.</p></h4>
		
		
		
		
         <h2>5.  Strengthen Your Bones</h2>

		<h4><p>Weight lifting doesn't only train your muscles; it trains your
        bones. When you perform a curl, for example, your muscles tug on yours
        bones.The cells within those bones react by creating new bone cells,
        says Perkins. Over time, your bones become stronger and denser.</p></h4>

        <h2>6.  Get Stronger, Obv</h2>

		<h4><p>Lifting lighter weights for more reps is great for building 
        muscle endurance, but if you want to increase your strength,
        increasing your weight load is key. Add compound exercises such as 
        squats, deadlifts, and rows to your heavy weights and you'll be
        amazed at how fast you'll build strength.</p></h4>
		


        <h2>7.  Prevent Injury</h2>


		<h4><p>Achy hips and sore knees don't have to be a staple of your 
        morning run.Strengthening the muscles surrounding and supporting
        your joints can help prevent injuries by helping you maintain good 
        form, as well as strengthening joint integrity.</p></h4>
		
        <h2>8.  Be a Better Runner</h2>
		
		<h4><p>Stronger muscles mean better performance—period. Your core
        will be better able to support your body's weight and maintain ideal
        form during other exercises (like running), plus your arms and legs
        will be more powerful.What's more, since strength training increases
        number and size of calorie-torching muscle fibers fueling your 
        performance, strength training could actually help you burn more 
        calories during your cardio workouts</p></h4>
		
        <h2>9.  Increase Your Flexibility</h2>

		<h4><p>Ignore that super ripped guy fumbling in yoga class for just a
        minute. Researchers from the University of North Dakota pitted static
        stretches against strength-training exercises and found that full-range 
        resistance training workouts can improve flexibility just as well 
        as your typical static stretching regimen.</p></h4>



        <h2>10.  Boost Heart Health</h2>
		
		
		<h4><p>Cardiovascular exercise isn't the only exercise that's, well,
        vascular. In fact, strength training can up your heart health, too. 
        In one Appalachian State University study,people who performed 45
        minutes of moderate-intensity resistance exercise lowered their blood
        20 percent.That's as good as—if not better than—the benefits
        associated with most blood pressure pills. </p></h4>
		
        <h2>11. Feel Empowered</h2>


		<h4><p>Throwing around some serious iron doesn't just empower women
         in the movies. Lifting heavier weights—and building strength as a 
         result—comes with a big self-esteem boost.Your strength will not 
         only show in your lean, toned body, but also in your attitude.</p></h4>
